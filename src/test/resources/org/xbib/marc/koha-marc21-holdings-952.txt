MARC21 Holding field, 3.0.x, 3.2.x and 3.4.x default - field 952

In 3.0.x and 3.2.x, holdings data is serialized and stored in repeatable 952 field. Information for each item should be introduced in a new 952 field repetition. The meaning of the subfields, and mandatory subfields is described in the following table.
As of 3.4.x, holdings data is no longer stored in a 952 field and that information is introduced in the items table only.
NOTE for 3.4.x: Even when holdings data is no longer stored in 952 field of marcxml/marc fields in the database, bulkmarcimport.pl script still reads holdings information from that fields.
